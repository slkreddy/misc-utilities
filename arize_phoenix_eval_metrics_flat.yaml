# ================================
# TEXT GENERATION EVALUATION METRICS
# ================================

# Relevance metric - measures how relevant the response is to the query
relevance:
  about: "Measures how relevant and appropriate the response is to the input query"
  threshold: 3
  prompt_template: |
    You are comparing a reference text to a question and trying to determine if the reference text
    contains information relevant to answering the question. Here is the data:
    [BEGIN DATA]
    ************
    [Question]: {input}
    ************
    [Reference text]: {output}
    ************
    [END DATA]
    Compare the Question above to the Reference text. You must determine whether the Reference text
    contains information that can answer the Question. Please focus on whether the reference text
    contains information that could help someone answer the question, rather than whether it directly
    answers the question itself.
    Your response must be a single word, either "relevant" or "irrelevant", and should not contain any other text.

# Helpfulness metric - evaluates how helpful the response is
helpfulness:
  about: "Evaluates how helpful and useful the response is to the user"
  threshold: 3
  prompt_template: |
    You are evaluating how helpful a response is to a user's question or request.
    
    Question: {input}
    Response: {output}
    
    Rate the helpfulness of the response on a scale from 1-5:
    1 = Not helpful at all, completely irrelevant or wrong
    2 = Slightly helpful, contains some relevant information but misses key points
    3 = Moderately helpful, addresses the question but could be more complete
    4 = Very helpful, comprehensive and addresses most aspects of the question
    5 = Extremely helpful, thorough, accurate, and goes above and beyond
    
    Respond with only the number (1-5).

# Coherence metric - measures logical flow and consistency

  threshold: 3
  prompt_template: |
    Evaluate the coherence of the following text response to the given input.
    
    Input: {input}
    Response: {output}
    
    Consider:
    - Does the response flow logically from one point to the next?
    - Are the ideas well-connected and consistent?
    - Is the overall structure clear and easy to follow?
    
    Rate the coherence from 1-5:
    1 = Incoherent, confusing, contradictory
    2 = Poor coherence, some logical gaps
    3 = Adequate coherence, mostly follows logically
