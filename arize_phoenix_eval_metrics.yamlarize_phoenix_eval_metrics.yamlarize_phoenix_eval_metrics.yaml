# Text Generation Evaluation Metrics
text_generation:
  # Relevance metric - measures how relevant the response is to the query
  relevance:
    name: "relevance"
    type: "llm_eval"
    description: "Measures how relevant and appropriate the response is to the input query"
    model: "gpt-4"
    template: |
      You are comparing a reference text to a question and trying to determine if the reference text
      contains information relevant to answering the question. Here is the data:
      [BEGIN DATA]
      ************
      [Question]: {input}
      ************
      [Reference text]: {output}
      ************
      [END DATA]
      Compare the Question above to the Reference text. You must determine whether the Reference text
      contains information that can answer the Question. Please focus on whether the reference text
      contains information that could help someone answer the question, rather than whether it directly
      answers the question itself.
      Your response must be a single word, either "relevant" or "irrelevant", and should not contain any other text.

      You are evaluating how helpful a response is to a user's question or request.
      
      Question: {input}
      Response: {output}
      
      Rate the helpfulness of the response on a scale from 1-5:
      1 = Not helpful at all, completely irrelevant or wrong
      2 = Slightly helpful, contains some relevant information but misses key points
      3 = Moderately helpful, addresses the question but could be more complete
      4 = Very helpful, comprehensive and addresses most aspects of the question
